# CS-255-Project

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client, DriverPass, wanted to create a system that allowed customers to practice and prepare for their driving tests, both on paper and on the road.  They wanted the customers to be able to take practice tests and attend classes related to the subject, specifically in regards to the DMV's rules and regulations.  They also wanted customers to be able to schedule on-the-road tests with specified drivers and vehicles.  

# What did you do particularly well?
I did well in creating appropriate, complete, and useful diagrams for which the system could be created from.  This includes UML Activity Diagrams, UML Sequence Diagrams, UML Use Case Diagrams, and more.  

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The UML Use Case Diagram in the Project Two System Document could be heavily improved now that I've gotten better with the tools and techniques required to create it.  Specifically, I have gotten more experience with LucidChart, which would allow me to make the diagram both clearer and cleaner.  

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When designing a system, it is vital that the system functions and operates in a way that allows the user to fulfill his/her requirements.  In this example, different types of users had different needs, such as how the customer needed to be able to schedule appointments, drivers needed to be able to confirm those appointments, the IT Admins needed to be able to maintain the system, and the owner of DriverPass needed to be able to download information/data from the system at any time.  When diesgning the system, it had to be ensured that the system could identify the different types of users, and give them each their required functionality.  

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, it is important to first have a plan about what the system must do, and an analysis of other systems that accomplish similar things.  With these two practices complete, the desired system is more well-defined, and there is a greater chance that the system will meet the requirements of the user.  When creating a system, it is almost always useful to use Agile/Scrum methodologies.  This includes reiterations, proper planning, frequent system-related meetings, and more.
